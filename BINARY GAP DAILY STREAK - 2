Given a positive integer n, find and return the longest distance between any two adjacent 1's in the binary representation of n. If there are no two adjacent 1's, return 0.

Two 1's are adjacent if there are only 0's separating them (possibly no 0's). The distance between two 1's is the absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two 1's in "1001" have a distance of 3.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 22
Output: 2
Explanation: 22 in binary is "10110".
The first adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 2.
The second adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 1.
The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
Note that "10110" is not a valid pair since there is a 1 separating the two 1's underlined.
Example 2:

Input: n = 8
Output: 0
Explanation: 8 in binary is "1000".
There are not any adjacent pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.
Example 3:

Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 in binary is "101".
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 109

## 💡 Approach

We use **Bit Manipulation** to solve this problem efficiently.

### Steps:

1. Traverse all 32 bits of the number.
2. Check if each bit is `1` using:
   ```
   (n >> i) & 1
   ```
3. Store the position of the last seen `1`.
4. Calculate the gap between consecutive `1`s.
5. Keep track of the maximum gap.

## 🧮 Algorithm

- Initialize `last = -1`
- Initialize `max_gap = 0`
- Loop from `0` to `31`
- If bit is `1`:
  - If `last != -1`
    - Calculate distance
  - Update `last`

ANSWER : 
class Solution:
    def binaryGap(self, n: int) -> int:
        
        # 🟢 Step 1: Initialize variables
        last = -1        # Stores last seen position of 1
        max_gap = 0      # Stores maximum distance
        
        # 🟢 Step 2: Loop through 32 bits (for integer)
        for i in range(32):
            
            # 🔎 Check if i-th bit is 1
            if (n >> i) & 1:
                
                # 🟡 If we already found a previous 1
                if last != -1:
                    max_gap = max(max_gap, i - last)
                
                # 🔵 Update last position
                last = i
        
        # 🟢 Step 3: Return maximum gap
        return max_gap
