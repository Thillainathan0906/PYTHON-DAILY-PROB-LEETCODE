Given two integers left and right, return the count of numbers in the inclusive range [left, right] having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1's present when written in binary.

For example, 21 written in binary is 10101, which has 3 set bits.
 

Example 1:

Input: left = 6, right = 10
Output: 4
Explanation:
6  -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
7  -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
8  -> 1000 (1 set bit, 1 is not prime)
9  -> 1001 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
4 numbers have a prime number of set bits.
Example 2:

Input: left = 10, right = 15
Output: 5
Explanation:
10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)
5 numbers have a prime number of set bits.
 
ANSWER :

class Solution:
    def countPrimeSetBits(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        
        # 🔹 Step 1: Initialize result counter
        result = 0
        
        # 🔹 Step 2: Function to check whether a number is prime
        def check_prime(n):
            
            # ❌ 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
            if n <= 1:
                return False
            
            # 🔍 Check divisibility from 2 to n-1
            for i in range(2, n):
                if n % i == 0:
                    return False
            
            # ✅ If no divisor found, it is prime
            return True
        
        # 🔹 Step 3: Iterate through numbers from left to right
        for i in range(left, right + 1):
            
            # 🔢 Step 4: Convert number to binary
            binary = bin(i)
            
            # ✂️ Step 5: Remove '0b' prefix
            binary = binary[2:]
            
            # 🔢 Step 6: Count number of set bits (1’s)
            count = binary.count('1')
            
            # 🧠 Step 7: Check if set bit count is prime
            if check_prime(count):
                result += 1
        
        # 🎯 Step 8: Return final result
        return result
